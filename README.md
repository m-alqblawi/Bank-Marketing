# Data Analysis Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis on a dataset. The notebook includes various functions for visualizing and preprocessing the data.

## Features

1. **Categorical Data Visualization**: The notebook includes a function to create horizontal bar plots for categorical columns using seaborn. The plots are displayed inline and side by side for easy comparison.

2. **Numerical Data Visualization**: The notebook also includes a function to create histograms for numerical columns using seaborn. Again, the plots are displayed inline and side by side.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes a function to replace 'unknown' values in categorical columns with the mode of the column.

4. **Normality Check**: The notebook includes a function to create QQ plots for numerical columns to check if they are normally distributed. The plots are displayed inline and side by side.

## Usage

To use the notebook, you need to replace the column names and DataFrame with your actual data. The functions can be called as shown in the notebook.

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
